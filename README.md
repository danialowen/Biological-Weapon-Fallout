# Biological-Weapon-Fallout
A model which predicts the final position of 5000 bacteria released from a biological weapon

This repository includes the model and the framework for the prediction of the final position of 5000 bacteria released form a building with an elevation of 75m.
The final position of these bacteria is controlled by the direction of the wind and the rate at which each individual bacteria falls.
